<h1>Comments in the Quizzer cycle</h1>
<p>Comments are shown to students who make specific mistakes in a quiz.
A quiz helps a student to engage actively with grammatical patterns,
and the examination to follow provides an added motivation for study.
Comments are a primary reference for students striving to improve
their sense of grammar and style.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access">
<h1>Access</h1>
<p>Each commenter has a unique personal link to their editing page. Commenters
receive a reminder mail once each week, on the day of the week set in the
administrator's <strong>Commenters</strong> configuration page. As a security measure,
the link changes each time the reminder mail is sent.</p>
<p>The top-level commenter editing page shows one or more <strong>Gloss</strong>
buttons for editing style and grammar rules, and a list of courses
(with a parenthetical indication of the number of uncommented quiz
mistakes in each). By navigating downward to a course, then to a quiz,
the commenter can reach the lists of quiz mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comment-syntax">
<h1>Comment syntax</h1>
<p>Comments use the <em>Markdown</em> syntax, a simple plain text markup format
commonly used for blog comments and online bulletin boards. A few
extensions have been added to the basic syntax, for commenting on
grammatical issues (an explanation of basic <em>Markdown</em> is available
<a class="reference external" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">here</a> -- the 'inline HTML' section describes the forms for
<em>italics</em> and <strong>boldface</strong>).</p>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>e.g.</strong> button to add the text of the mistaken answer at the top of an empty comment.
(this button has no effect when there is already text in the comment box):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; There is only one regulations.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="numbered-markers">
<h2>Numbered markers</h2>
<p>Numbered markers can be added to an example by enclosing a single letter or number in double
paretheses:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
((a))
</pre>
<p>These will be converted to their circled equivalents when the comment is saved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="numbered-spans">
<h2>Numbered spans</h2>
<p>A span of text can be marked for commenting by moving the closing double parentheses to
the end of the span:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
There is only ((1 one regulations)).
</pre>
<p>A numbered marker will be inserted, and highlighted together with the span of text.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pattern-examples">
<h2>Pattern examples</h2>
<p>The single greater-than symbol inserted by the <strong>e.g.</strong> button will render as an
indented block highlighted in red. This represents a &quot;bad&quot; example.</p>
<p>To show a &quot;good&quot; example, use to two greater-than symbols:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt; There is only one regulation.
</pre>
<p>The indented block will be highlighted in green.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-and-glosses">
<h1>Rules and Glosses</h1>
<p>To add a rule flagging a common issue that is not yet covered by the pulldown list
of rules (see below), use three greater-than symbols in a comment:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Verbs: avoid using passive verb forms
</pre>
<p>It is best practice to begin a rule with a catch-word to permit rapid searching in
the pulldown list. The rule text can be edited later, so it is not necessary to fret too
much over the exact phrasing.</p>
<p>If a rule is set at the very top of a comment, it will be removed from the comment
and added as a separate &quot;rule&quot; comment. Otherwise, it will appear in the comment
as an indented box with white background. In either case, the rule is immediately
made available in the pulldown list for subsequent comments.</p>
<div class="section" id="glosses">
<h2>Glosses</h2>
<p>To add an explanation or examples to a rule, visit the top-level commenter editing
page and click on the <strong>Gloss</strong> button for a given language. Clicking on a rule
will open it for editing. After saving, the explanatory text will be shown to
students who are fluent in the target language.</p>
<p>The headline text itself can be edited only for rules owned by the current commenter.
The headline text of shared rules cannot be edited: the rule must first be delegated
to an individual commenter by the administrator.</p>

<p>Quizzer is a simple quiz engine meant to support the small-scale needs of a single instructor (a few classes, a few hundred students). The code is incomplete as of this writing, but will be fully functional by end of January 2014.</p>

<p>Quizzer was originally conceived as a tool to support academic writing classes.
The idea is to build quizzes from 400-word essays submitted by
students, using grammatical errors, errors in usage, and examples of
awkward expression as raw material (to add a peer-pressure element,
the name of the student from whose essay each question is drawn can be
displayed in each question). Typical workflow will be to construct questions with a bad
example, an equally bad example, a corrected sentence, and a corrected
sentence containing a common error. This is a manual process: we're not trying to <em>eliminate</em> the instructor here, but to help him or her to engage with students more effectively.</p>

<p>Students are registered on the system with a name an email address. Classes and class membership are managed with a simple menu-driven interface. Quizzes created for a class are sent to enrolled students with a click. For simplicity, the system uses access codes
embedded in the URL for each quiz instance. There is no login at the student end: they just click on the link and take the quiz. The engine randomizes the sequence of questions and
responses.
Quiz responses are saved only when the full quiz has been completed.
If the quiz page is refreshed before completion, the quiz is
re-randomized, and starts over from the beginning. There is no time
limit: this is a tool for study, rather than examination.</p>

<p>Final marking is automated (of course), and stored on the server in CSV format.
The display of results can be collated on-screen by class performance on each question, or on student performance on the quiz as a whole, and the results can be downloaded for local record-keeping.</p>

<p>Administrators all have global write access within a Quizzer server instance. By default, the system uses the GMail SMTP server for mailing of quizzes.</p>

Some ideas

Speech!

Button to clone initial pasted text to other choices.

Option to pull in a fixed number of the questions most often missed in
previous quizzes for a class.

Bundled download of questions for archiving and reuse.

Content-sharing consent toggle on student record.

Explanation field, for instant feedback when wrong answer is selected.

Two links in student mail: one for text, the other (heavier) with
speech support. If that turns out to work reasonably well.

Pulldown list of students in question drafting display, for
optional note of student author prompting the question.
Shown only at quiz-time, not in feedback/results display.

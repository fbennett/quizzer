Some ideas

***

Main priority at the moment is to tidy up the code in quizServer.js,
by splitting functionality out to library modules, and implementing
a simple pluggable framework for transaction sets.

***

Option to pull in a fixed number of the questions most often missed in
previous quizzes for a class.

Bundled download of questions for archiving and reuse.

Content-sharing consent toggle on student record.

Team settings. Three to four students can be set as a team, whose
scores in the final exam will be averaged. If strongest students are
matched with the weakest, we get a community of teachers and learners.

Student keys should be set on memberships, not on student records.
Key can then be reset automatically each time a new quiz is sent out,
foreclosing late submissions.

Students should be provided with a refreshed link to their overall
results view (access controlled by the temporary key) in each quiz
mailing.

Add a "Vistor" toggle to student records, so that non-members
can be excluded from summary listings, but still receive feedback.

Some ideas

***

Held code:

        var adminKey = uriObj.parsedQuery.admin;
        var studentID = uriObj.parsedQuery.id;
        var studentKey = uriObj.parsedQuery.key;
        var classID = uriObj.parsedQuery.classid;
        var pageKey = uriObj.parsedQuery.page;
        var quizNumber = uriObj.parsedQuery.quizno;
        var cmd = uriObj.parsedQuery.cmd;

Main priority at the moment is to tidy up the code in quizServer.js,
by splitting functionality out to library modules, and implementing
a simple pluggable framework for transaction sets.

Remove students listing and top page, and support adding/editing
of student records in classes UI.

Move records to sqlite3.

Add search support.

Add student records upload to class view, with "new" toggle to force display of records.

Add a Confirm button to class view, to remove "new" toggle and conceal all Non-Member
records by default.

Add a Select All tick-box to Members listing in class view.

Add a Purge button to cull student records that are not associated
with a class.

Implement report views.

Implement written tests.

Implement marking of written tests.

Include a list of current urls in quiz mailings.

Add a Reset Keys tick-box next to Send Quiz in class view.

Implement flash cards based on missed items. Cards will have a hint
and a limited-vocabulary pattern to commit to memory printed on their
face. Student can transcribe the hint on the back in the language of
their choice, and drill themselves. Will depend on an additional,
optional feedback field in questions.

How to deliver the above? As a standard set, or as a targeted printout?
Probably the former makes more sense -- a study pack for all students,
based on errors commonly observed in their work.

Bundle as npm and release.

Bundled download of questions for archiving and reuse.

Content-sharing consent toggle on student record.

Student keys should be set on memberships, not on student records.
Key can then be reset.

Students should be provided with a refreshed link to their overall
results view (access controlled by the temporary key) in each quiz
mailing.

Add a "Vistor" toggle to student records, so that non-members
can be excluded from summary listings, but still receive feedback.

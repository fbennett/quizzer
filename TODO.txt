Some ideas

* Set foreign key constraints in database schema.

* Implement barcode marking of printed exams.

* Allow setting of external toggle on "student" records, and
  suppress in Stragglers and exam paper runs.

* Provide CSV download of exam results.

* Allow scheduled notifications to external class members
  and commenters, resetting access keys at each notice
  interval.

@@NAME@@:

Thank you for offering to comment on student work in our writing
program. We appreciate the value of your time, and our students will
benefit greatly from any constructive feedback you can offer.

Your personal link to the commenting system is updated regularly as a
security measure. The link below is valid for the coming week:

After navigating to the quizzes for a class, you will find a list of
mistaken responses students have made to questions on grammatical and
style issues. Many responses are tagged with the native language of
students who missed that particular question.  Comments in the
students' own language can be particularly helpful, as this is often
beyond our own capacity.

A few shorthand forms are available to make preparing clear, targeted
guidance as simple as possible. To set up the "wrong" answer as an
example, paste it into the text box, and put a single ">" character at
the beginning of the line:

    > This article is of the laws of Utopia nowadays.

You can mark a specific portion of the example by enclosing it in double
parens, and adding a single letter or number after the opening parens:

    > This article is ((1 of)) the laws of Utopia ((2 nowadays)).

To state a pattern, begin the line with two ">" characters (the
example below also illustrates how to add italics):

    >> The story is *about* soccer.

To state a rule, use three ">" characters:

    >>> Never use the word "nowadays" in formal writing.

Circled markers can also be written by enclosing a single letter or
number in double parens:

    This was ((1)) first reform of corporate law.

That's about all there is to it. Again, we are grateful for your
contribution. If you can spend a few minutes this week reviewing quiz
errors, our students will be motivated to put in their very effort
during their period of study.

Sincerely yours,
